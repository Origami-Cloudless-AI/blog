# Problem: No Cloud, No AI
::: columns
:::: column
## How AI works now:

1. IoT device sends data to Cloud DC
2. Data is processed by Cloud AI
3. Prediction is sent back to IoT device
4. IoT device actuates control

**Cloud AI** depends on network connection,

- Too **far** away to respond quickly
- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **expensive** unnecessarily

# Solution: Cloudless AI with tiny Machine Learning
We _squeeze_ ML smaller,
_run_ on microcontroller in IoT device,
where sensor data is _processed_ locally.
This is called,
